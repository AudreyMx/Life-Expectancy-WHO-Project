# Life-Expectancy-WHO-Project
This is my data analytics project for NIYO Bootcamp.

My objectives were; 
- Understanding the relationship between life expectancy and economic factors 
- The relationship between the status of a country and life expectancy 
- To analyze the correlation between expenditure on healthcare and education on life expectancy 
- To analyze the effects of HIV/AIDS, Polio and immunizations on life expectancy

My findings: 
I found that there was positive correlation with many of the factors and life expectancy. But the biggest factor on life expectancy was the GDP of the country. That affected whether or not they spent on resources in the country, which resulted in a decline/ neglect in other socioeconomic areas.
